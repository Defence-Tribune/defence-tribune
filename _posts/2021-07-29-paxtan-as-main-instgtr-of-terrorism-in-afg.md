Pakistan. It's the elephant in the room when it comes to Afghanistan. First, let's deal with Pakistan's geostrategic position. This is important – it helps explain a lot of behaviour. Pakistan got a raw deal out of partition. Four provinces in North western India and one in the East which was to last only 25 years. One of which (North West Frontier) are basically minimally governed Pashtun tribal lands. And there were/are governed under an arcane set of laws – The Frontier Crimes Regulations. And their border with Afghanistan – the Durand line – drawn in 1893 by the Brits deliberately splits the Pashtun down the middle.

Back when the vast geography of the Soviet Union extended till the Northern fringes of the Wakhan Corridor, roughly 80 kms from the nearest British Police kiosk in the Northern fringes of the raj, it made sense then from the British point of view of defending British India. Now, it's total rubbish, which is why no Afghan government (not even Pakistan's proxy the Taliban) has ever accepted the Durand line as the nation's border. The other province of Pakistan that is troublesome is Baluchistan – lots of natural resource wealth, massive, [sparsely populated, and separatist](https://www.aninews.in/news/world/asia/5-soldiers-killed-in-terror-attack-in-balochistan-pak-army20210625150431/). Both of these provinces border Afghanistan – and it is worth pointing out that in the 1960s and 70s Afghan governments did sponsor separatist movements during the premiership of Muhammad Daoud Khan in before the Saur revolution in 1978. But long story short, Pakistan did indeed received the cream of the Indian subcontinent on both sides. the fertile Indus on one side, and the Brahmaputra on the other. But on the western side, they got somewhat a rough deal out of Partition with India when the Brits left.

## And so to India...
How can anyone talk about Pakistan and not mention India, the pinnacle of Pakistani obsession. Worth noting that this is not reciprocated – Senior Indian generals described Pak as an annoying gnat, and China as a vicious tiger, in terms of geostrategic risk). The main bone of contention being Kashmir.

So, with this geostrategic mindset, how does Pakistan view Afghanistan?

Many speak of [geostrategic depth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_depth#In_reference_to_Pakistan) against India – as if Pakistan could retreat a tank division into Afghanistan in order to counter strike against the Indians. This really does not wash me. Pakistan's aim in Afghanistan is to make sure that there is a government friendly to Pakistan in Kabul; or AT THE VERY LEAST, that there is a government in Kabul that is not friendly to India. Think about it from the Pakistani point of view – an India-friendly Afghanistan would sandwich Pakistan between two hostile states.
- No Afghan government ever has accepted the current form of the Durand Line. They claim Pashtunistan and Baluchistan as theirs. And who better to be a bulwark against the Pakis than India.
- A stable government in Afghanistan would always be hostile to Pakistan given whatever it has done to the country ever since the Americans started pouring in through the Wakhan corridor, which was the heartlands of the Anti-Taliban Northern Alliance. [Now, not so much](http://inozpress.kg/en/wp-northern-afghanistan-once-kept-out-the-taliban-why-has-it-fallen-so-quickly-this-time/).

And so, Pakistan has consistently had a policy of either supporting groups that will hopefully gain power, or destabilising Afghanistan. A destabilised Afghanistan is ok from a Pakistani point of view – an acceptable outcome, because it means they can concentrate on the nemesis – India. So South Asia had this long policy of supporting proxies in Afghanistan, the land that is called the graveyard of Empires. During the 1980s, there were a variety of groups but then the Pakistani Army settled on [Gulbuddin Hekmatyar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulbuddin_Hekmatyar), the leader of Hizb-e Islami. They liked him for ages, and then when it looked like he wasn't going to win, they switched over to the Taliban in 1994. They very heavily supported the Taliban in the original push for Kabul in 94/95 including providing military advisors and allegedly artillery and helicopter support in the original push in the south. And it worked. [The Taliban took Kabul](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrrPd9ym-oU). And then they did what most proxies do – they stopped doing what their sponsors wanted. Hence – the Taliban government didn't support the Pakistani request to recognize the Durand Line. But broadly they had what they wanted – a government they were not at all friendly to India. And the 9/11 happened and Bush threatened to bomb Pakistan back into the stone age if they didn't cooperate in getting the Taliban to hand over Osama. Remember, at this point of time America had a plethora of sanctions on Pakistan for their nuclear testing in 1998. (Even the tech for making the bombs [was stolen by their scientist, Abdul Qadir Khan while working in The Netherlands](http://www.historycommons.org/timeline.jsp?timeline=aq_khan_nuclear_network_tmln&aq_khan_nuclear_network_tmln_a__q__khan_s_proliferation_network).

Musharraf convinced the US that they were supporting them, [whilst convincing them to fly ISI officers who were supporting the Taliban out of Afghanistan](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2002/01/28/the-getaway-2/amp). At some point around then, or maybe later, they also started hiding Osama, [just down the road from the Pakistani Army HQ](https://www.voanews.com/east-asia/bin-laden-raid-raises-questions-about-Pakistan). Extraordinary. I mean, who would have guessed it, right?

## And this brings us to the next theme in the Pakistan-Afghanistan relationship:
The Outside sponsors plays an important role in the boondwoggle that is going in that part of Asia. From the late 1970s until pretty recently, the US was the main financial and military backer of Pakistan. In the 1980s that worked fine – both wanted the same outcomes in Afghanistan: defeat the communist government. In the 1990s not so much, but the US wasn't really paying attention. It was distracted elsewhere with Iraq and Somalia and Yugoslavia.

The war in Korea made America realize that a regional supporter was needed to win a war, or rather to make it easier to transfer the line of supplies. Pakistan had a direst border with Afghanistan, but Iran was hostile to America. So, Pakistan it was. They imparted training to the Pakistani Army in the hope that they would teach the Mujahideen. But what was really happening is that, if you read their military journals, the Pakistanis were learning from them, not with the intention they supposed to learn it with.

But then in the 2000s, the US continued as the main backer of Pak, but their interests diverged. The Pakistanis still wanted the Talibs in charge, or at least a chaotic Afghanistan (see reasons above). But the US wanted a stable, western leaning government, which the Pakistanis were worried, would be anti-Pakistani (not surprisingly after all the mess the Pakistanis had done in Afghanistan). So then we had the following, head spinningly crazy situation:
- The US and its allies (UK etc) poured trillions ($2.3tn in fact) into building Afghanistan up, at the same time that they poured billions into Pakistan, WHO THEN PROCEEDED TO SEND IT ACROSS THE BORDER TO SUPPORT THE TALIBAN, WHO WERE FIGHTING THE US AND ITS ALLIES.
- Leaks of diplomatic cables show that the US knew this from at least 2005, if not earlier.

And the Afghans starting from Burhanuddin Rabbani to Sibghatullah Mojaddedi were surprised. They were astounded not by the fact that Pakistan was funding the Taliban, by rather by the audacity with which they were doing it. It was so obvious that it still eludes me how could the likes of William Cohen, Donald Rumsfeld and Geoff Hoon have missed it. Was it sheer complicity or the West bowing down to the Pakistani demands of a large sum of money just for access to Afghanistan. We might never know till the next Edward Snowden comes in.

Back to the topic. In many parts of Afghanistan, many Afghans assumed that the US and the UK were working with the Taliban in order to destroy Afghanistan. In Helmand, where the Quetta Shura is insinuated to have shifted, 90% of Helmandis thought the Brits and the Talibs worked together. There were other reasons for this too like the Brits built percentages for bribes into their supply contracts which got extracted as bribes and then bled into the conflict ecosystem as weapons which were then used to attack themselves, but that is a story for another day.

But is Pakistan to be blamed entirely? Not really. The leaders of Pakistan have a very weak geostrategic hand of cards to play. And so, they play them as described. They are obsessed with India when India is not as fussed. But the Taliban have been gaining some serious ground there. So, Pakistanis are definitely doing something right. But what are the leaders of the US and its allies doing? The UK might argue (as it has in private) that the UK needs cooperation with Pakistan because of the huge Pakistani diaspora in the cities of London and Birmingham amongst whom there might be a small number of terrorists too. I can understand that argument, but then don't run that policy alongside one where you have troops in Afghanistan. Just shit policy making.

As for the US – who knows. I don't think they know what they've been doing in Afghanistan for years. But this then brings me to Pakistan's next sponsor: China. So, China sees Pakistan as part of its Belt and Road Initiative – connectivity down to the Indian Ocean. And as an ally, it is a great way to box in India (for China – both Pak and China agree on India as a competitor). So perhaps in this sense Pak and China could agree on Afghanistan (in a way that the US and Pak couldn't since 2001). A stable gov in Afghanistan that was pro-China, pro-Pak, and anti-India could work for them. But up until now China had outsourced much of its Afghan policy to Pakistan. This might change soon.

China knows well enough that Pakistan has double crossed every country that came to look for stability, peace and trade in the heartland of the Silk Road. Now it is left to be seen whether Pakistan double crosses China too to keep it as its own backyard and allow the Chinese in there like they have done with their own country. I guess the question for the future is how closely aligned can Pak and China keep their Afghan policies. [They disagree on much else](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/16/world/asia/china-Pakistan-bus-crash-blast.html): sponsorship of terrorism for instance. There are a lot of Chinese workers in Pakistan. I can't imagine the Chinese government putting up with this for long (but Pak needs some of these groups to challenge China in Kashmir).

So, there is a lot up in the air about how the Pak-Afghan relationship will develop. Well, all said and done, Pak would be facing a blowback of Talibanis both ways.
- If Taliban wins, an assertive Taliban which won't toe Pak line on Durand/ China/ Tehreek-e-Taliban-Pak/ Islam
- If Taliban loses, rest of Afghans including Public are already against Pak.

The biggest blunder India made was to having failed at making any real allies and inroads into Afghanistan even with the 2 trillion dollar investments in it.

## What India can do to make the most of out of it?
India would either want a friendly government in Afghanistan, and if that is not possible, keep stroking tensions in the country. Because history from 1978 teaches us that whenever things in Afghanistan seem unstable, Central Asia goes all upset, Pakistan's economy tumbles and diverts a large portion of its already depleted army to the Western border.
