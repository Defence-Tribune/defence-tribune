# HOW TO DEAL WITH THE CHINESE BEHEMOTH

After the surprise incursion from China last summer and the Galwan valley incident , I have been trying to understand the logic of China, by studying their history, language , culture et al

As with India, China also should be studied based on it’s current position in it’s civilizational and historic journey. And in that journey, there is not a more important than this theme of “Unification with China”. This unification phase and a disintegration phase is a repeated pattern in Chinese history. Hence it becomes important to understand which phase they view themselves to be in, in the present. And in their collective imagination they appear to be in a unification stage

These phases are often separated by decades, if not centuries. To the layman, it can be described as a luxury and privilege garnered by 1000 years of unbroken civilizational history. Coming out of a century of humiliation, determined not to be ruled by a foreign power ever again the first phase of the unification process was done by none other than the eccentric Mao Zedong. Whatever is currently going on in Hong Kong can be looked upon as both the instigation of America and an aggressive China hell bent on carrying on the process of unification to the mainland. Analysing the root of the problem is imperative to understanding the subject’s mindset and gameplan.

The subject of Taiwan however overrides the the case of Hong Kong. There is no historic basis for Taiwan to be a part of China except for maybe a couple of centuries. But in the collective imagination of both the people and the highest echelons of the Communist Party of China, reunification of China has become a civilizational goal and an imperative.

## But where does India fit into all of this?
To understand this, we will need a bit more context of the “Entire History” of the unification that happened under the Qin dynasty. Especially about King Hui of Qin and his advisor Zhang Yi. Before Qin started off on the unification journey south and elsewhere, they had to first deal with the potential danger of the northern tribal chiefdoms collectively called the Hu.

So they pre-emptively attacked the Hu before they started their actual unification campaigns. The used to assess oportune moments to settle the northern areas, and they have had to do it repeatedly, before they go on for their main extension campaigns. This “Oportune moments” is a key factor here.

From China’s point of view it is important to assess 2 factors:

India’s intent (as expressed by actions and intentions)
Plug any disadvantaged hole that could bother them when they are busy elsewhere.
India’s intent as expressed by the words of the homme minister in the Parliament, Amit Shah stated that it was their intent to take back Aksai Chin. Although it was just taken as blabber at face value. I doubt he understands the difference between Aksai Chin and Akshay’s Chin. But actionwise, India is rightfully building up it’s long neglected border infrastructure. This process has got accelaration since the beginning of this decade, and something the Premier of the country, Narendra Modi government has excercised additional focus on as well as to his credit.

Then in April 2020, we signalled a potential decoupling from China, with our executive order preventing FDIs from neighboring countries. Suddenly India said “We do not welcome Chinese money any more”. After this incident, we should definitely have been more prepared.

So, now they have to settle their western border to blunt any advantage that India might have had in the region, before they focus on their more reunification dream. For without settling the “northern areas” ,”Qin” could not have pursued unification. Here is when the most opportune moment came. Due to the novel coronavirus pandemic, India retained the reserves in the peacetime locations unlike any other summer The time to blunt any potential aggression advantages and settle the border to their 59 line once and for all.
