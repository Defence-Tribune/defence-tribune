Several reports have emerged that a large number, in fact over a thousand mostly Helmandi and some Kandahari Talibs are moving up to Kabul to assume the internal security of Kabul.
<hr>
Although we are engulfed by misinformation of the 21st century on a humongous scale, I will try to explain what this means on the political sprectrum of Afghanistan. Firstly, that the central Talibs trust most the Southerners the most. Considering the emergence of the Taliban for the first time in 1991 came from the Southern city of Kandahar, which also served as the de-facto capital of the Talibani regime during it's rule of Islamic Emirates of Afghanistan. This will inevitably cause frictions with the Talibs who rocked up in Kabul who were from places like Logar.

This subsequently has created huge issues for countries like US and UK evacuations. The US and the UK did most of their fighting in the south. Particularly places like Helmand. Particularly places that have a strong culture of revenge. [It is interesting to note that the Taliban shifted their ideological indoctrination centers from the Pakistani city of Quetta (Quetta Shura) to Helmand in Afghanistan.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ_pDKhg7bQ). No matter what the central Talibs want - there will be Helmandis in that group that will have lost close relatives due to the actions of US and particularly UK forces. They would be honour bound to extract revenge. I am not talking full scale attack here, I am taking pot shots at the gate whilst US/UK doing crowd control or evacuating their citizens. Here we find out how strong the control of the Talibs fighting factions are by the central leadership. Strong enough to overcome the requirements for revenge? This maybe about to become the most anxious time for the evacuation. And this is just the eighth day since the Islamic Emirates breathed for the second time in Kabul since Mullah Omar was forced to flee. 

The British troops in particular are exceptionally loathed by the Helmandi tribes whom they’ve fought in three wars since the 1840s (Brits unaware of this when they blundered into Helmand in 2006). The battle of Maiwand for instance - always held up as an Afghan national victory - was largely due to the presence of the Alizai, Barakzai and Noorzai militias. [(PS: There was also a woman that led the charge of the battle after the flagbearer fell.)](https://www.news18.com/news/buzz/did-you-know-who-malala-yousafzai-is-named-after-1794085.html). Every Helmandi knows the names of the leaders of that fight - Ahktur Khan in the 1840s and Abu Bakr in the 1880s. The names bring a smile to their faces when you mention them. They are proud of their resistance to the British. Consider them the freedom fighters of their time. I guess another thought is about what this means for Kabul - Helmand is about as far away as it is possible to get from Kabul on the conservative-cosmopolitan scale. 

This is bad news for Kabul, especially its women (whom Helmandis, in the main, treat like shit).

What’s also interesting is that there still isn’t a Taliban government formed or announced. God it must be taking time trying to negotiate all those factions. Kabul fell on Sunday. It’s been a full week. We’ve had one press conference. Multiple reports of Taliban going round Kabul with lists looking for former intelligence officers and senior army etc. These are then disappeared. I know the UK and US need to make nice during the evacuation, but there must be a response to what effectively are extrajudicial killings. You might think where did these lists come from ? To be honest, the Americans used biometric devices to identify the Afghans that were working for them. And just when the Americans are about to leave, the Taliban finds it. **How convenient**. With respect to all everyone trying to get out of Kabul: an entire generation of educated people who want to leave and will - utterly damming on the Talibs. At some point are the Talibs are going to realise what a brain drain this represents? How do you build a county without educated people?
It is becoming increasingly clear that the central Talibs don’t really have full control over the Talibs at the check points, which themselves are a patchwork of different groups of Talibs from the surrounding provinces. This further proves my point that the Taliban is in fact not a single monogamous entity. They didn’t expect to win this quickly, or should I say , did not expect American complicity at such a fast rate. And they have no movement-wide agreement on how to proceed. Big disagreements about power, factions and government.
That’s just within the movement. There are also discussions around Hamid Karzai and Abdullah Abdullah, the head of the Afghan national Reconcilliation Committee along with Gulbuddin Hekmatyar who were meant to do the transition negotiations but these were scuppered by Ghani fleeing. So this effectively means that the transition government styled along a the Iranian one but more stringent led by Mullah Ghani Baradar would indeed be permanent. The democracy so promised by the West to Afghans is evidently poised to fail. Because the ministers so chosen will not be chosen by the people, but rather by a Shura, which basically boils down to a close aide munchkins of the Supreme religious leader of Afghanistan. 
Ghani says he fled because Talibs entered the city but is this another example of central and local Talibs not being able to coordinate?

The real question that concerns me about the leadership of the nation is about the whereabouts of Haibatullah. There are rumours that he has died of covid.

Seems there are some fairly big rifts between the roughly three groups of Talibs who are in Kabul. 

- the Haqqani lot, whose leader we have seen in meetings with Karzai
- the Helmandis and kandaharis with senior people like Zakir (ex gitmo)
- Another group of Tb from Jalalabad, Laghman, and Nuristan.

This is clear that a lot of jostling for power is taking place. This doesn’t even take into the hundreds of talib check points that are each with a random talib group. Central Talib movement doesn’t have control of the logistics of the country. As mentioned earlier, now from several sources: ISI-linked Taliban are leading the hunt for ex-NDS etc Ghani government people. This is causing some gov employees to go into hiding. Which is having an impact on the feelings of chaos in Kabul. It seems that the Talibs are playing the old Afghan game: haggling over the Chawqai (literal meaning: chair, meaning seats of power). This is both internal amongst the factions and involves trying to bring in other non- Talib factions. To be fair to them, this sort of negotiation should have occurred in 2001 instead of the victors’ peace that was concluded in the Bonn Conference. But it will take ages to get a government going like that. And in the meantime we have the evacuations and the hunting of ex-government employees. 

## But why do I speak about Zakir ?

Once released from Guantanamo he was then held in Afghan gov detention. He was one of the guys that the US forced the Afg gov to release last year **due to pressure by tribal elders**. What a catastrophic blunder. I suppose we will look back on the 5000 freed Talibs as one of the most stupid aspects. Might even land on "Curb your overconfidence" videos on YouTube. 

The one thing that annoys me most is giving the Talibs social media space. Former US President Donald Trump and Indian IT Minister were suspended on the American micro blogging platform Twitter but more than 25 accounts with direct affiliation to the Taliban with almost 200 Thousand followers operate with impunity. Their main intention was to live like their prophet did 1500 years ago. I do think the closest thing to Internet back then were horses. *Look out for more deviations from the ... muh prophet desert man*

[The Taliban say their deputy leader, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, has arrived in Kabul and is in talks to form a new government.](https://twitter.com/bbcpashto/status/1428826798310187009)

Looking at the situation right now, I cannot say the Taliban is at power. Or rather, they have not reached there as of yet.

Who are the main stakeholders in the Talibani regime right now ?
 - Haqqani Network - They are the largest group within the Talibani ranks. Also the ones who entered kabul first with 6000 cadres. Rather the only ones in Kabul.
   - Sirajuddin haqqani - He is said to be passing instructions from Quetta, Pakistan.
   - Anas haqqani - Leader of the faction that entered Kabul, and brother of Sirajuddin. And also met with Hamid Karzai, Abdullah and Gulbuddin Hekmatyar
   - Khalil Haqqani - Uncle of Sirajuddin Haqqani. Currently serving as Taliban's head of security in Kabul
- Muhammad Yaqoob - Son of erstwhile taliban leader, Mullah Omar.
  - 1st Vice- emir of Taliban
  - He is the head of Talibani millitary commission.
  - Right now, he is at Kandahar where the movement first began in 1996, it is the traditional seat of Pashtuns. 
  - It was at Kandahar where Mullah Omar was given the title of Amir-ul-Momineen. 
  - Yaqoob is said t have metb with Ghani Baradar, the vice-emir of IEA, second in command to Haibatullah Akhundzada
- Mullah Haibatullah Akundzada - Emir of Afghanistan
  - The religious head of Taliban
  - Currently based in Karachi
  - Poised to become the Supreme leader. The Afghan counterpart of Iran's Ali Khameini.
- Abdul Ghani Baradar - 2nd Vice  - emir of Taliban.

  - Has his family in New Delhi, India. Wife and 4 children.
  - Currently in Kabul with Karzai

- Gulbuddin Hekmatyar - Currently a part of the Karzai-Abdullah team in Kabul rallying to transfer of Power.
  - Also called " **Butcher of Kabul** " because of his deliberate attempts to fire at the civilian population
  - Although all the clans including Rabbani, Dostum, and Massoud were party to the destruction brought upon Kabul, Hekmatyar was largely responsible for it.
  - Hekmatyar's Hezb-e-Islami was the largest organization funded by Pakistan's secret organization ISI. 
  - He also had the support of former UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
  - The Pakistani military had supported Hekmatyar until then in the hope of installing a Pashtun-dominated government in Kabul
  - Later, incarcerated and requested independance in exchange for government recognition and respect for the Afghan Constitution.
  - Hated Burhanuddin rabbani and Ahmad Shah Massoud

- Ashraf Ghani - Former President of Afghanistan.
  - Currently in UAE, contemplating return to Afghanistan or move to USA
  - His son Tarek Ghani lives in a 1.2 Million dollar house with his wife Elizabeth Pearson a mile from the Capitol in Washington DC

- Amrullah Saleh - Currently the legitimate President of Afghanistan after Ashraf Ghani abdicated.
  - Right now in Panjshir Valley with Ahmad Massoud, the son of Ahmad Shah Massoud - Lion of Panjshir.
  - Both Saleh and Massoud are born and brought up in Panjshir.
  - Currently they are spearheading Resistance 2.0 against taliban along with Afghan soldiers like General Haibatullah Alizai, General Sami Sadat and others who managed to escape to the Valley 

It should come as no surprise that Yaqoob and Haqqani hate each other. One is the largest faction while the other is the most popular within the Taliban. They themselves are stunned by the occupation of Taliban as everyone else. The Helmandis want female education shut down but the Haqqanis, Wardakis & Logaris insisted on keeping them. Power everywhere is about postions as well as issues. It all starts to look like and East-West Pushtun split. So what’s the balance going to be in the new Talib government between the four major Pashtun confederations
1. Durrani (Toba Achakzai) ---------- North
2. Ghiljai (Ghazni / Qalati Ghilzi)--- South
3. Karlani (Baraki Barak) ------------ North
4. Sarbani (south-west) -------------- South

Let alone other ethnicities.

The Taliban can claim not to export any narcotics but at the end of the day their 9 billion dollar revenue that was stored in American banks will not be handed over to them and neither will the IMF hand over a bunch of loans to a cash starved land which does not have a legetimized government. There have been reports that Helmandis have been chilling away their victory in the Ministry of Finance but what they need to chill out is a Finance minister and an auditor who would figure out where all the Afghan money is stored. The last time taliban captured Kabul, they had three finance ministers within their short 5 year rule all of whom were accused of corruption allegations, the most famous one being Agha Jan Motasem. 

## Fratricide.. ?

A report suggests that Helmandis are also in charge of parts of Kabul whereas the Haqqanis have been given the charge for the city. If they do not communicate properly, there might even be bloodshed amongst them. Something like a violent version of the race between Ivan Konev and Georgy Zhukov in Berlin.

On the other hand, Taliban hint that they are hoping to resolve Panjshir through talks, presumably through Abdullah Abdullah. Or maybe Is the ‘resistance’ just a negotiating strategy for the Panjshiris? But for now I have a few questions that bother me.
1. As the inter Taliban factions negotiations continue, can we say it is true that what allowed the Taliban to take over—a series of local deals along tribal lines—may well stop them forming the political coalition necessary to form a government?
2. In a month or so are we going to see Taliban factions turn on each other?
3. is what we’re seeing with both the Helmandis/Kandaharis & the Haqqanis rocking up actually a power struggle within the Taliban leadership playing out on the ground in Kabul? Both claim they are responsible for the security of Kabul.

However though,
1. Mullah Shirin, a Kandahari, appointed Governor of Kabul by Quetta Shura. 
2. Anas Haqqani appointed Kabul’s in charge of discipline by Quetta Shura.
3. Khalil Haqqani appointed by Sirajuddin Haqqani as Kabul's chief of security

The balance is clearly tilted towards the Haqqanis. 


It is pretty apparent that the factionalism within the Taliban are more distinct than the 38th Parallel in Korea from space. I do not understand why NATO failed to exploit these ridges within the Taliban. 
- Haqqani Network - These are the insurgents well before the taliban was even born. They have their networks operating from Pakistan to Iran.
- Helmandis - These are the locals of places like Helmand, and Sangin who have connections to Iran, and until recently with Pakistan when taliban decide to shift Quetta Shura
- Kandaharis - These people are really strongly connected to pakistan.
- Herat - A totally different thing with different factions ruling at a certain point of time.

Apparently it has also come to light that Abdul Rahman Mansur (a Helmandi, from Baghran District in Helmand) is the Talib Governor of Kabul, on top of the feud that is already taking place. The scales of Helmandis and Haqqanis are now even. Also Baghran is the most conservative district in the most conservative province. Very interesting. The funniest thing about this large void of warlords is that random Talibs are going round to Ministries and government departments and asking employees where the money is. Shaking them down. They basically don’t know how government works, says someone who experienced this. *If it wasn’t so tragic it would be hilarious*
A couple of hundred Helmandis turning up every day in Kabul. still tensions between the Helmandis (who have started to take over checkpoints) and the Haqqanis. There have been rumours circulating in Kabul that there are plains clothes ISI officers embedded in the Haqqani group.

Now arises the question **if Hibatullah, the leader of the Taliban not yet seen, is actually dead, who is going to lead the movement?**
About that, on August 21, the spokesperson for Political office of the Taliban based in Qatar said:

> A delegation from the Political Bureau of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, under the supervision of Sheikh Shahabuddin Dawar, met with a number of political figures in Kabul today. During the meeting, the delegation of the Islamic Emirate assured the political figures of their security and safety.

> The delegation of the Islamic Emirate said about the future of the country that the Islamic Emirate wants a strong central system that respects the rule of law, that is free of corruption and in which every citizen has the opportunity to serve his country and its people.

This of course is usually the kiss of death in Afghanistan which probably needs a lot more decentralisation (as centralisation requires force to enforce). They are of course at the moment trying to work out the structure of their government. If stuff like this is solid, it would seem to suggest that the Talibs are trying to craft a ‘Afghan national’ flavour to their government, rather than a jihadi flavour which is acceptable both to their factions and also to the international community. There are basically three interlocking circles that the Taliban leadership have to square:
- Internal Taliban factions (Haqqani, Helmandis etc)
- Other Afghan factions e.g. Panjshiris, Hazaras, etc)
- External recognition.

And they all affect each other.

## Conclusion


Panjshris are Tajiks and Tajiks are around 13 million people in Afghanistan. Also Hazara and Uzbeks make up 7.5 million. So together they make up 60% of population and cannot be ignored. Also, there have been reports of Ahmad Massoud surrendering. Almost 100 years ago King Habbibulah made peace with Nadir Khan he swore an oath on the Holy Quran and still executed him. **The talibanis cannot be trusted**
